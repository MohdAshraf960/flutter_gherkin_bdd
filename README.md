# Gherkin BDD - Flutter Project

Welcome to the Gherkin BDD Flutter project! This project focuses on utilizing the Gherkin syntax for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) in the context of a Flutter application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Flutter and Dart installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.

## Steps to Run the App and Tests

Follow these steps to run the app and execute tests using Gherkin syntax:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Run the app using the following command:
   ```
   flutter run -t test_driver/test.dart --verbose
   ```
   This command launches the app using the main function defined in `test_driver/test.dart`.

3. While the app is running, observe the observatory URI. It will look something like:
   ```
   Connecting to service protocol: http://127.0.0.1:61658/RtsPT2zp_qs=/
   ```

4. Open another terminal window.

5. Change the directory to the `test_driver` folder using the following command:
   ```
   cd path/to/gherkin_bdd/test_driver
   ```

6. Run the Dart test script with the observatory URI using the following command:
   ```
   dart <file_name>_test.dart <uri>
   ```
   Replace `<file_name>` with the actual name of your Dart test file, and `<uri>` with the observatory URI obtained in step 3.

## Running the App and Tests

Follow these instructions to run the app and execute Gherkin BDD tests:

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Launch the app using the following command:
   ```
   flutter run -t test_driver/test.dart --verbose
   ```

3. While the app is running, take note of the observatory URI provided, which will be similar to:
   ```
   Connecting to service protocol: http://127.0.0.1:61658/RtsPT2zp_qs=/
   ```

4. Open another terminal window.

5. Navigate to the `test_driver` directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/gherkin_bdd/test_driver
   ```

6. Run the Dart test script using the observatory URI:
   ```
   dart <file_name>_test.dart <uri>
   ```
   Replace `<file_name>` with your Dart test file's name and `<uri>` with the observatory URI from step 3.
